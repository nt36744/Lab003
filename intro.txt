Hello this is just a regular text file and I will write a brief introduction for myself. My name is Nicole and I'm turning 20 this winter. I caught a cold recently, but I'm not sure where I got it from. 

One of my hobbies is running. I've been trying to run as consistently as possible, but since I'm sick right now, I haven't ran in a couple days.
